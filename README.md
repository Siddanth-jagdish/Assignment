# Review Analysis using NLP, Spacy and ML
Analysis of Reviews dataset (NLP , SPACY and machine learning)

Imported libraries like spacy, pandas, numpy, tfidf

Explored the dataset to find the best features for the analysis and converted boolean to numeric values for reviews.doRecommend column

Have implemented NLP and spacy functionalities by doing following operations
  1. removal of stopwords
  2. removal of punctuations
  3. tokenization
  4. lemmatization

Have used Tfidf vectorizer to focus on the frequency of the words present in the corpus and also to know the importance of words and also so that the least valued words could be ignored

Have used logistic regression for the classification task and confusion matrix and classification reports for performance ealuation

Concluded by showing a basic word cloud visualization for generic, good and bad reviews.

was a good experience working on this assesment, can't hide the fact that was also busy in between as i also had other tests going on. In case if the quality of the assesment is unsatisfactory, kindly let me know if i could do any sorts of future enhancements.

Thank you
